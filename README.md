#  Responsive Sidebar Menu (No JavaScript)

This project demonstrates a **responsive toggle sidebar navigation menu** built **purely using HTML and CSS**, without a single line of JavaScript.

It uses a hidden checkbox + label trick to show/hide the menu (commonly known as the **CSS-only toggle technique**), ideal for lightweight responsive websites or portfolios.
